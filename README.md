Wine Quality Classification using Logistic Regression
This code reads in a wine quality dataset, preprocesses the data by converting the categorical variable "color" into a numerical variable, splits the data into training and testing sets, scales the feature variables, fits a logistic regression model on the training set, makes predictions on the testing set, and calculates the accuracy of the model.

The code is written in Python and uses the pandas, numpy, sklearn.linear_model, and sklearn.preprocessing libraries.
